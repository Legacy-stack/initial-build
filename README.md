# First Project

This was my very first web project, built when I was just starting to learn HTML and CSS.

It's super simple: a basic personal page with a couple of small projects I made while practicing. 

## What I learned

- Basic HTML structure
- Simple CSS styling
- How to use images and links
- Embedding CodePen projects

## Disclaimer

It’s not perfect (at all), but it represents where I started. I'm keeping it here as a reminder of how far I’ve come.
